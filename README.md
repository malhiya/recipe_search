## Notes
I had difficulty understanding Routes but I then saw the routes video resource that CodePath had in the Resources section. This helped me have a better understanding of links and routes. I also had trouble creating a chart so I asked chatGPT on how to go about it. I also googled it to find more resources. I then downloaded recharts and was able to create a histogram for my data.

## Notes

* One cchallenge I encountered was with the proper syntax for calculating the lowest calories from the list of recipes. I asked chatGPT and it showed me the errors of what I did and the correct way to type it out.
* Another challenge I was having was with filtering the recipes. I had trouble keeping track of the original search of recipes and then the newly filtered recipes. I asked chatGPT and it gave a solution of adding another state variabled called filteredRecipes. This way I can have the original search and then the newly filtered search.
