## Notes
I had difficulty understanding Routes but I then saw the routes video resource that CodePath had in the Resources section. This helped me have a better understanding of links and routes. I also had trouble creating a chart so I asked chatGPT on how to go about it. I also googled it to find more resources. I then downloaded recharts and was able to create a histogram for my data.
